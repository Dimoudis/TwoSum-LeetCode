# TwoSum Exercise

This repository contains two Java solutions for the **Two Sum** problem from LeetCode, used for practice.

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`,  
find the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

## Solutions

# 1. Brute-force
- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
- Description: Checks all possible pairs in the array to find the solution.

# 2. HashMap (Optimized)
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
- Description: Uses a HashMap to store numbers and their indices for fast lookup.

# Usage
- Both files have a `main` method and can be run directly in Eclipse or any Java IDE.  
- Example array and target are hard-coded for testing.
